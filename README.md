![Chatbot Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccabd714-09f3-494d-bcc1-dfdd1f50a393)

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered agricultural advisory chatbot** fine-tuned from the **Gemma 2B** model. It is designed to support Nigerian farmers ‚Äî starting with maize production ‚Äî by providing **instant, location-aware, and practical farming advice** from **site selection** to **storage**.  

The chatbot addresses key agricultural challenges such as lack of timely advice, climate variability, and poor access to expert guidance. Farmers can interact in plain language to receive **reliable, research-backed recommendations**.

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered agricultural advisory chatbot** fine-tuned from the **Gemma 2B** model. It is designed to support Nigerian farmers — starting with maize production — by providing **instant, location-aware, and practical farming advice** from **site selection** to **storage**.  

The chatbot addresses key agricultural challenges such as lack of timely advice, climate variability, and poor access to expert guidance. Farmers can interact in plain language to receive **reliable, research-backed recommendations**.

If you’d like, I can also make a **PDF “one-pager” project brief** from this README so you can attach it alongside your CV when applying — this can make your chatbot stand out even more to the TALLHEDA selection panel.  

Do you want me to prepare that one-pager?
